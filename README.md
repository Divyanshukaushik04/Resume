**Research Interest** is how we measure scientists' interest in your research.
Metrics are a powerful tool to evaluate science and move it forward. When used well, metrics can help researchers and institutions understand how their research is being received and applied around the world. But deciding what constitutes a good metric is a complex issue. While no single metric can give you the full picture of the impact your research is having, we believe that Research Interest can help you complete the picture.
